## üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ABOUT ME

I am a dedicated software engineer in my senior year at UC San Diego, where I study Computer Science and Cognitive Science, set to graduate in June 2024. My ambition is to excel as a full-stack web developer, a goal I actively pursue through both academic and practical experiences.

Key Experiences:
- **CodePath Courses**: Completed the Intermediate Technical Interview Preparation (TIP 102) and Intermediate Web Development (WEB 102) courses. In TIP 102, I honed my skills in technical interview strategies, while in WEB 102, I deepened my knowledge in React.js.
- **Software Developer at UCSD's CSE Society**: Engaged in developing dynamic and efficient websites, with a proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. I'm known for my ability to transform complex design concepts into functional web applications, ensuring quality with meticulous testing, and consistently enhancing my skills to stay aligned with the latest web development trends.

I'm enthusiastic about leveraging my growing expertise in web technologies and my collaborative skills to contribute to impactful projects in the tech industry.
